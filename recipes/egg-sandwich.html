    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>At the heart of a great egg sandwich is a creamy egg filling and essential to this are soft boiled, not hard boiled eggs! The creamy yolks practically makes its own mayonnaise sauce and the soft-set egg whites almost dissolve in your mouth.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 soft boiled eggs <em>(at room temperature)</em></li>
        <li>1 tbsp whole egg mayonnaise <em>(S&W brand best)</em></li>
        <li>2 tsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>2 tsp finely chopped chives <em>(sub green onion)</em></li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Mash Egg: </strong>Place the eggs in a bowl and crush with a fork. Once mostly broken up, use a potato masher to mash them up really well. Smaller egg white bits = creamier filling.</li>
        <li><strong>Filling: </strong>Add remaining filling ingredients and gently stir to combine. Taste and add more salt if desired, but add with caution because it's bizarre how little salt eggs can take!</li>
        <li><strong>Make Sandwich: </strong>Butter the bread. Divide filling between 4 pieces of bread, spread evenly edge to edge. Trim crusts (optional), then cut as you wish. (Note 4 tips)</li>
        <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Always serve at room temperature, for best flavour!</li>
    </ol>
